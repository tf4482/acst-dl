## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (recommended) or pip

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd acst-dl

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd acst-dl

# Install dependencies
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Configuration

Create or modify the [`acst-dl-config.json`](acst-dl-config.json) file to configure your downloads:

```json
{
  "urls": {
    "Podcast Name 1": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-name-1",
    "Podcast Name 2": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-name-2"
  },
  "output_directory": "~/data/podcasts",
  "timeout": 30,
  "max_mp3_links": 5,
  "download_mp3_files": true
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `urls` | Object/Array | Required | Dictionary of named URLs or array of URLs to process |
| `output_directory` | String | `"downloads"` | Directory where files will be saved |
| `timeout` | Number | `30` | Request timeout in seconds |
| `max_mp3_links` | Number | `null` | Maximum number of MP3 links to extract per URL |
| `download_mp3_files` | Boolean | `false` | Whether to download actual MP3 files |

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python acst-dl.py
```

The script will:
1. Read configuration from [`acst-dl-config.json`](acst-dl-config.json)
2. Create output directories as needed
3. Download HTML content from each configured URL
4. Extract MP3 links from the downloaded content
5. Optionally download the MP3 files themselves

### Output Structure

```
output_directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Podcast Name 1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain_path_timestamp.html
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ podcast_name_1_mp3_links_timestamp.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audio_files_timestamp.mp3 (if download_mp3_files is true)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Podcast Name 2/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain_path_timestamp.html
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ podcast_name_2_mp3_links_timestamp.txt
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audio_files_timestamp.mp3 (if download_mp3_files is true)
```

## Features in Detail

### MP3 Link Extraction

The script uses multiple methods to find MP3 links:
- Parses HTML elements (`<a>`, `<audio>`, `<source>` tags)
- Uses regex patterns to find direct MP3 URLs
- Maintains order of appearance in the original HTML
- Supports configurable limits on number of links extracted

### File Management

- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes temporary HTML and link files after successful MP3 downloads
- **Duplicate prevention**: Skips downloading files that already exist
- **Progress tracking**: Shows download progress for large files
- **Timestamped filenames**: Prevents filename conflicts

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling for network issues
- Graceful handling of malformed URLs or HTML
- Detailed error reporting and logging
- Continues processing remaining URLs even if some fail

## Dependencies

- [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - HTTP library for downloading content
- [`beautifulsoup4`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - HTML parsing library
- [`pyinstaller`](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) - For creating standalone executables

## Examples

### Extract Links Only

```json
{
  "urls": {
    "My Podcast": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/my-podcast"
  },
  "output_directory": "./podcast_links",
  "download_mp3_files": false,
  "max_mp3_links": 10
}
```

### Download Latest Episodes

```json
{
  "urls": {
    "Daily News": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/daily-news"
  },
  "output_directory": "~/Downloads/podcasts",
  "download_mp3_files": true,
  "max_mp3_links": 3,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

The script supports the old array format for URLs:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-1",
    "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-2"
  ]
}
```

## Building Standalone Executable

Use PyInstaller to create a standalone executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile acst-dl.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Config file not found**: Ensure [`acst-dl-config.json`](acst-dl-config.json) exists in the same directory as the script.

**Permission errors**: Check that the output directory is writable and you have sufficient permissions.

**Network timeouts**: Increase the `timeout` value in the configuration for slow connections.

**No MP3 links found**: Some podcast feeds may use different formats or require authentication.

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can modify the script to add more verbose logging or run with Python's `-v` flag for detailed output.
