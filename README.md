- 🔄 Support for both old list format and new dictionary format URLs

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (recommended) or pip

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd acst-dl

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd acst-dl

# Install dependencies
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Configuration

Create or modify the [`acst-dl-config.json`](acst-dl-config.json) file to configure your downloads:

```json
{
  "urls": {
    "Podcast Name 1": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-name-1",
    "Podcast Name 2": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-name-2"
  },
  "output_directory": "~/data/podcasts",
  "timeout": 30,
  "max_mp3_links": 5,
  "download_mp3_files": true
}
```

**Note**: Hash-based duplicate detection is now enabled by default and requires no configuration.

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `urls` | Object/Array | Required | Dictionary of named URLs or array of URLs to process |
| `output_directory` | String | `"downloads"` | Directory where files will be saved |
| `timeout` | Number | `30` | Request timeout in seconds |
| `max_mp3_links` | Number | `null` | Maximum number of MP3 links to extract per URL |
| `download_mp3_files` | Boolean | `false` | Whether to download actual MP3 files |

### Hash-Based Duplicate Detection & Automatic Cleanup

The script now automatically prevents downloading duplicate MP3 files and keeps folders clean by:
- 🔐 **Generating unique filenames** using MD5 hash of the URL (e.g., `media_43e4489f.mp3`)
- 📁 **Checking file existence** before downloading
- ⚡ **Skipping duplicates** automatically without any configuration needed
- 🧹 **Automatic old file cleanup** - removes MP3 files not in current download set
- 🗑️ **Keeps only recent files** - maintains clean directories with latest episodes
- 🎯 **No database required** - uses simple filename-based detection and memory tracking

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python acst-dl.py
```

The script will:
1. Read configuration from [`acst-dl-config.json`](acst-dl-config.json)
2. Create output directories as needed
3. Download content from each configured URL (HTML pages, RSS feeds, etc.)
4. Extract MP3 links from the downloaded content
5. Optionally download the MP3 files themselves

### Output Structure

```
output_directory/
├── Podcast Name 1/
│   └── media_43e4489f.mp3 (hash-based filename)
│   └── media_7ac9803d.mp3 (hash-based filename)
└── Podcast Name 2/
    └── media_20830c0e.mp3 (hash-based filename)
    └── media_32758bac.mp3 (hash-based filename)
```

**Note**: Temporary content and MP3 links files are automatically cleaned up after successful downloads.

## Features in Detail

### Hash-Based Duplicate Detection & Automatic Cleanup 🔐

The script automatically prevents downloading duplicate files and maintains clean directories by:
- **URL-based hashing**: Each MP3 URL generates a unique MD5 hash
- **Smart filename generation**: Files are named `{base_name}_{hash}.mp3`
- **Instant duplicate detection**: Same URLs always produce the same filename
- **Memory tracking**: Stores current filenames during download process
- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes old MP3 files not in current download set
- **Keep only recent**: Maintains clean directories with latest episodes only
- **No configuration needed**: Works automatically without any setup
- **Bandwidth savings**: Skips re-downloading identical content
- **Storage efficiency**: Prevents duplicate files and removes outdated ones

### MP3 Link Extraction 🎵

The script uses multiple methods to find MP3 links:
- Parses content elements (`<a>`, `<audio>`, `<source>` tags for HTML)
- Uses regex patterns to find direct MP3 URLs
- Maintains order of appearance in the original content
- Supports configurable limits on number of links extracted

### File Management 📁

- **Automatic cleanup**: Always removes temporary content and link files when MP3 downloading is enabled
- **Hash-based duplicate prevention**: Intelligent detection using URL hashes
- **Old file removal**: Automatically deletes MP3 files not in current download set
- **Clean directories**: Keeps only the most recent episodes, removes outdated files
- **Single-line progress tracking**: Clean progress display for large files
- **Rich console output**: Emoji-enhanced feedback for better user experience

### Error Handling ❌

- Comprehensive error handling for network issues
- Graceful handling of malformed URLs or content
- Detailed error reporting with emoji indicators
- Continues processing remaining URLs even if some fail

## Dependencies

- [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) - HTTP library for downloading content
- [`beautifulsoup4`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - HTML parsing library
- [`pyinstaller`](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) - For creating standalone executables

## Examples

### Extract Links Only

```json
{
  "urls": {
    "My Podcast": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/my-podcast"
  },
  "output_directory": "./podcast_links",
  "download_mp3_files": false,
  "max_mp3_links": 10
}
```

### Download Latest Episodes with Duplicate Detection

```json
{
  "urls": {
    "Daily News": "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/daily-news"
  },
  "output_directory": "~/Downloads/podcasts",
  "download_mp3_files": true,
  "max_mp3_links": 3,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

**Note**: Hash-based duplicate detection is automatically enabled when `download_mp3_files` is `true`.

### Backward Compatibility

The script supports the old array format for URLs:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-1",
    "https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/podcast-2"
  ]
}
```

## Building Standalone Executable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Config file not found**: Ensure [`acst-dl-config.json`](acst-dl-config.json) exists in the same directory as the script.

**Permission errors**: Check that the output directory is writable and you have sufficient permissions.

**Network timeouts**: Increase the `timeout` value in the configuration for slow connections.

**No MP3 links found**: Some podcast feeds may use different formats or require authentication.

**Duplicate detection**: Files with the same URL will always generate the same hash-based filename, preventing re-downloads.

### Console Output

The script provides rich emoji-enhanced output including:
- 🚀 Startup and configuration loading
- 📋 Processing status with progress indicators
- 🎵 MP3 extraction and download status
- ⏭ Duplicate detection notifications
- 🗑️ Old file cleanup notifications
- ✅ Success confirmations
- ❌ Error messages with clear indicators
- 📊 Detailed summary statistics with cleanup counts

### Debug Mode

For debugging, you can modify the script to add more verbose logging or run with Python's `-v` flag for detailed output.
